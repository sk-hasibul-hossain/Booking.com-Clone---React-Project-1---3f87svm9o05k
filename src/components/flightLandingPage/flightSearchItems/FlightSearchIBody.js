                  You can sort flights by price to see them from cheapest to
                  most expensive. To find the cheapest flights, you also need to
                  consider factors such as when you are booking and when you
                  want to travel.

                <p>
                  You can book a flight up to one year before your departure
                  date.

                <h2>Do flights get cheaper closer to departure?</h2>
                <p>
                  Generally, flight prices are more likely to increase the
                  closer you get to your flight date.

                <p>
                  A flexible ticket allows you to change your flight with the
                  same airline company by only paying the fare and tax
                  difference. It can only be used for one confirmed change. You
                  are able to add the flexible ticket when booking your flight.

                <p>
                  No, we don't charge any credit card fees. You can always see
                  exactly what youâ€™re paying for in the price breakdown when you
                  review your booking.
